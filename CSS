THe order goes like html>>head>>title>body>>main>section>section
You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
element {
 property: value;
}
Center your h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center.
You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.

First, add an hr element between the p element with the class established and the first section element. Note that hr elements are self closing.
You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
a:visited {
  color: black;
}

a:hover {
  color: black;
}

a:active {
  color: brown;
}

It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller.
The h2 ments have default top and bottom margin space, so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.

There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions.
Negative values are created using a - in front of the value. 
To complete this project, go ahead and use a negative top margin of 25px in the img type selector.
