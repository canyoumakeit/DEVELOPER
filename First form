The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.
As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, 
add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other.
label has for attribute; 
input has id attribute is under which the input should be listed;
type attribute  to deteermine the type of data to be inserted,VALUE=THE ACTUAL text that appears on the wem page, required attribute for * (must enter data);
minlength to custom input data length from user;type=file to insert a file in a website.
The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS.
The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.
Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.
With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.

Naming a radio button:<label >Personal<input  type="radio" /></label>
        <label>Business<input  type="radio" /></label>
You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time.
To solve this, you can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text Account type (required) before the label elements within the second fieldset. Then add the checked attribute to the Personal input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it.
Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload.
Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.

Start by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then nest 5 option elements within the select element.
During development, it is useful to see the fieldset default borders. However, they make the content appear too separated.

Remove the border, and add 2rem of padding only to the top and bottom of each fieldset. Be sure to remove the padding from the left and right.
The border of the last fieldset element looks a little out of place. You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class, like this:

p:last-of-type { }
That will select the last p element. Create a new selector that targets the last fieldset element and set its border-bottom to none.
fieldset:last-of-type { 
  border-bottom:none;
}
